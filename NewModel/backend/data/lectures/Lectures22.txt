Hello, my name is Terry Sol, and this is Programming Chaos, a channel devoted to projects that you can use to hone your programming skills. Today's project is reaction-diffusion models, which simulate the interaction of two or more chemicals and are used to create interesting and colorful patterns. These patterns are often used in games or artwork to replicate the kinds of designs seen on animals. For example, the patterns can resemble zebra stripes, allowing you to generate various organic-looking designs by adjusting the model's parameters.

The general idea is to model how two or more chemicals interact. The model is divided into cells, each containing the concentration of two or more chemicals. In this example, we have a red chemical and a green chemical. The concentrations of each chemical are defined within each cell. The model includes a reaction where one chemical changes into the other and a diffusion process where chemicals spread out from their current cell. To program this, we need to delve into the math behind how the reaction and diffusion occur.

Many reaction-diffusion models exist, but I will use the Gray-Scott model, which is relatively simple and models the interaction of two chemicals, A and B. To understand this, we must look at how the concentration of each chemical changes within each cell. The mathematical equations for these changes might look intimidating at first but are manageable. For chemical A, the concentration at the next time step is based on its current concentration, adjusted by diffusion and reaction terms. The diffusion term represents the chemical spreading to neighboring cells, governed by a diffusion constant. The reaction term accounts for chemical A converting into chemical B.

For chemical B, the process is similar. It starts with its current concentration, adjusted for diffusion and reaction. The Gray-Scott model sets the diffusion constants as follows: chemical A has a diffusion constant of 1, while chemical B's is 0.5. The reaction term for B increases its concentration as chemical A is converted into B. To balance this, a "kill rate" (parameter K) removes some chemical B from the system. This ensures that concentrations remain within reasonable bounds.

You can think of this as analogous to a predator-prey system. Chemical A can represent prey, which increases over time but is consumed, allowing predator B to grow. Diffusion spreads the chemicals across the grid, and we use specific weights for neighboring cells to determine how much of each chemical flows between them. These weights ensure conservation of the total amount of each chemical. The diffusion values are symmetric and can be adjusted to experiment with different outcomes. For example, in image processing, these same principles apply when blurring or sharpening images. Instead of concentrations of chemicals, we deal with pixel values, and the process is called convolution.

To implement this in code, we use matrices to represent chemical concentrations in the grid. One matrix stores the current concentration, and another temporarily holds the updated values for the next time step. This prevents overwriting values during calculations. To start, we define constants like the diffusion and reaction parameters and initialize the grid. Most cells are filled with 100% chemical A and 0% chemical B, except for a few cells that start with some chemical B to seed the reaction.

The code also includes parameters to control the grid's size and resolution. For testing, larger cells and coarser resolution allow faster computation, but you can reduce the cell size for finer details. Initializing the grid involves nested loops to iterate over rows and columns. The primary setup fills the grid with chemicals, prepares the matrices, and defines the reaction-diffusion rules.

Once the initialization is complete, the model applies the reaction-diffusion equations iteratively to simulate the interaction and diffusion of chemicals. The resulting patterns can vary depending on the chosen parameters, and you can experiment with different values to produce diverse visual effects.
